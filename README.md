# Smart_Attendance_Using_LiveFaceDetector
It's basically a attendance meter which detects the attendance of the student through live tracking of it's face

what does this project do is that it detects the face of the person and and then the user is said to blink their eyes and if the eyes blinked then the system matches 
the face encoding with the database and if a face match with the one in database it will mark attendance of that particular student with the time of entry 


So with the help of this system no one can mark their false attendancde with just their photos.

It was a quite intresting project for me to do 

Hope You Like It.................
